Hi, This is an In-House project assigned by the college staff. 

This task was assigned to me in-order to showcase my technical skills as my company internship didn't had any technical projects assigned to me at that time.

This is an Android Project Developed using Android Studio IDE and Java Language.

Silent BT is an app that works as a messaging app between two devices without the use of any network provider.
This app uses Bluetooth as means of communication between two devices.
